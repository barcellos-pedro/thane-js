*Deliver simple web apps in an old fashion way!*

## Quick Story

Based on what i knew about Node, Express, Django and Laravel, I wanted to exercise my knowledge.

So I staterd to tinker around with some npm libraries [on a project](https://github.com/barcellos-pedro/poc-express-handlebars).

After that i could only think about trying to build a new way of starting a new web app using Node and Express.

To provide that experience in a lean framework inspired in some tech stacks like: Lamp, Mean, Mern and Tall.
