*Deliver simple web apps in an old fashion way!*

## Story

Using as inspiration of existing tech stacks like:

- Lamp (Linux, Apache, MongoDB, PHP)
- Mean (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Nodejs)
- Mern (MongoDB, Express, React, Nodejs)
- Tall (Tailwind, Alpine, Laravel, Livewire)

I wanted to create an easy old fashion framework to build mvc web apps.
